# When

We have been building the AI to govern the forecasting models for the past two years (.5 Crypto Winters + 1 pandemic), while another team has been building the OEMS.   The fund itself is not set up yet (and we can't emphasize that enough, legally!).  We are, however, launching the data experiment:  an alpha test of the core AI + decentralized feature engineering functionality.

Once we alpha test it, we'll launch our Discord, etc. in Q2 2022.  Then launch a permissioned (tokenless) variant in Q3 2022.  Once the system is decentralized enough & regulators say 'cool,' we'll airdrop a token and have a staking system that will let us go permissionless.
