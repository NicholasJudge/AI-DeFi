# Alpha Test What And Why

We have been building the AI & OEMS for two years.  Time to alpha test it.

Most quants & quant funds have incredibly valuable features they've spent months or years building.  But they don't have another year of free time to try to translate it into a systematic strategy - or their mandate prevents them from pursuing directional systematic strategies.  Examples might be a stable coin fund that tracks cross-chain stable coin flows, or market makers who have great order book data but their mandate prevents them from non-market neutral strategies.   Features that are super-useful for some tasks, and probably super useful for intra-day market forecasts.

Just send us your (unlabelled) data.  Think of our AI as a box that takes about ten lines of code to dump your puzzle pieces into, saving you a year or so of full-time work trying to put the puzzle pieces together.     You'll get a great report assessing your data relative to what else is in our system.   Once the fund is live, you'll be handsomely reworded if your data improves fit.  For details about our AI, check out our (lightly) technical 3-pager (pdf in this repo).

It's a low-effort way to (further) monetize your feature engineering work, while gaining valuable intel on your features relative to what else is out there.
