The goal of a systematic (algorithmic) fund is to scale a space of well-engineered features so algorithms can turn them into price forecasts, and software can execute trades based on those forecasts.  

With the advent of DeFi, we believe, if you have the right AI and incentive structure, you can scale that feature space further on the rails of decentralized protocols than on the rails of the of the traditional fund model. 

"Oh and one more thing:"  If this project - or a project like it - doesn't take off, then all of DeFi basically becomes a software stack built for free for legacy institutions.
