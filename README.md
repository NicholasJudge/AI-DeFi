# AI-DeFi
For the past two years, I have been building an AI platform for systematic trading, capable of assessing & assembling inputs - data **and** algorithms - at a large scale.  That scale is so large, in fact, that it could be used not just as an in-house tool at a quant fund, but to coordinate action from a decentralized network of data scientists, econometricians and quantitative developers.     

In this repo you'll find pdfs for a simple one-pager describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though still is relatively digestible.  

Now that it is at the point capable of handling inputs at scale, I am undecided as to whether I raise a mini (<$1m USD) round, or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data & order and execution infrastructure is already built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
