# AI-DeFi_Proposal
An AI platform for systematic (algorithmic) trading I have been building for two years scales to the point it could be used either as in-house architecture at a fund or to govern a decentralized network - or both.

In this repo you'll find pdfs for a simple one-pager describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though still is relatively digestible.  

Now that it is at the point of complexity where I can no longer build everything, I am undecided as to whether I raise a mini (<$1m USD) round, or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data & order and execution infrastructure is already built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
