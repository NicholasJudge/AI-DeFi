# AI-DeFi

It is crazy that DeFi doesn't have a decentralized systematic fund as a front-and-center goal right now.  I'm not talking about a forecasting competition like Numerai, or some degen bots.  A single systematic strategies typically has a multi-year dev cycle.  I'm talking about something capable of keeping DeFi from becoming just a software stack for legacy financial institutions.

For two years, I and a few partners have been building an AI platform for systematic strategies, capable of simultaneously assessing & assembling inputs - data **and** algorithms at scale.  At some point along the way, I pinged a grad school friend, Princeton Professor Marc Ratkovic, for help.  While I fancy myself an expert on these issues, Marc has been cited more than a thousand times, so he definitely is.  Our talks led to Marc coming on as a cofounder.

The goal is to reduce the time and coordination costs of scientific research.  These reduced costs open the door to scaling a quant fund's all the way up to operating as a decentralized fund.  

Click on the files in this repo to find a super-short deck presenting the basics, a one-pager pdf describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though is still pretty digestible.  My CV and Marc's CV is also up there, if you're curious.  

Now that it is ready to be scaled up, we think it's time to raise a small round.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
