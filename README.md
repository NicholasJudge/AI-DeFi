# AI-DeFi
For the past two years, I have been building an AI platform for systematic trading, capable of assessing & assembling inputs - data **and** algorithms - at a large scale.  That scale is so large, in fact, that it could be used not just as tool for a fund doing a lot of modeling, but to coordinate action over a decentralized network of data scientists, econometricians and quantitative developers.     

In this repo you'll find a simple one-pager pdf describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though is still pretty digestible.  

Now that it is ready to be scaled up, I am undecided as to whether I raise a mini (<$1m USD) round, or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data & order and execution infrastructure has already been built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
