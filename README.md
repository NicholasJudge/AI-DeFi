# AI-DeFi

For two years, I and a few partners have been building an AI platform for systematic strategies, capable of simultaneously assessing & assembling inputs - data **and** algorithms at scale.  At some point along the way, I pinged a grad school friend, Princeton Professor Marc Ratkovic, for help.  While I fancy myself an expert on these issues, Marc has been cited more than a thousand times, so he definitely is.  Our talks led to Marc coming on as a cofounder.

The goal is to reduce the time and coordination costs of scientific research.  These reduced costs open the door to scaling a quant fund's forecasting capabilities; or, more ambitiously, to a decentralized systematic fund.   

Click on the files in this repo to find a super-short deck presenting the basics, a one-pager pdf describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though is still pretty digestible.  My CV and Marc's CV is also up there, if you're curious.  

Now that it is ready to be scaled up, we are undecided as to whether to raise a small round or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data and order and execution infrastructure has already been built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
