# AI-DeFi_Proposal
An AI platform for systematic (algorithmic) trading I have been building for two years is so scalable it could be used either as a very effective in-house tool or to govern a decentralized network

In this repo you'll find a simple one-pager describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though still is relatively digestible.  

Now that it is at the point of complexity where I can no longer build everything, I am undecided as to whether I raise a mini (<1m USD) round, or take it in house somewhere where much of the data infrastructure is already built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
