# AI-DeFi
I have been building an AI platform for systematic strategies, capable of simultaneously assessing & assembling inputs - data **and** algorithms - at a large scale.  That scale is so large, in fact, that it could be used not just as in-house at a quant fund, but to coordinate action over a decentralized systematic fund.     

Click on the files in this repo to find a super-short deck presenting the basics, a one-pager pdf describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though is still pretty digestible.  My CV is also up there, if you're curious.  

Now that it is ready to be scaled up, I am undecided as to whether I raise a small round or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data and order and execution infrastructure has already been built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
