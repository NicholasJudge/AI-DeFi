# AI-DeFi_Proposal
An AI platform I have been building for two years is so scalable it could be used either as a very effective in-house tool or to govern a decentralized network

In this repo you'll find a simple one-pager describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though still is relatively digestible.
