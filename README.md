# AI-DeFi
For the past two years, I have been building an AI platform for systematic trading.  It is scalable enough to be used either in-house at a fund with a very large data environment or to govern a decentralized network.  

In this repo you'll find pdfs for a simple one-pager describing the parts of the IP that I can make public, and a technical three-pager that goes a bit more in-depth, though still is relatively digestible.  

Now that it is at the point capable of handling inputs at scale, I am undecided as to whether I raise a mini (<$1m USD) round, or take it in-house somewhere where much of the data & order and execution infrastructure is already built.  Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!
